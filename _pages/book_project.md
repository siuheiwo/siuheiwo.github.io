"Forecasting the Use of Force: A Word Embedding Analysis of China’s Rhetoric and Military Escalations"(Revise and Resubmit to Political Science Research and Methods)
------

Are implicit threats made by autocracies reliable proxies for forecasting military escalations? While the conventional hands-tying mechanism asserts that a state’s official rhetoric binds it to a position, limiting its ability to back down, recent literature on bluster suggests that autocracies may also use hawkish rhetoric to justify inaction and de-escalation ex post. This research evaluates these competing perspectives by analyzing China’s rhetoric and military escalations. Using a word embedding approach, I introduce an original Chinese-language lexicon that captures China’s implicit threats. I present systematic evidence that China’s implicit threats against adversaries correlate with the likelihood of its military escalations. These findings provide new empirical insights into the debate between bluster and hands-tying mechanisms.
