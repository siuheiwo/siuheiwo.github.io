Mapping China’s Influence at Multilateral Institutions
------
![header image](/images/guterres_xjp.jpg)


With [Courtney Fung](https://www.courtneyfung.com/). Does China exert influence at multilateral institutions?  If so, how?  Analysts note that a rising China is coming to dominate multilateral institutions, pointing to China’s lead of four of the fifteen UN specialized agencies; the frequency of PRC rhetoric injected into international diplomatic discourse; and the linking of signature PRC projects, like the Belt and Road Initiative, to multilateral programs.  As China assumes a greater leadership role in the United Nations system, China has stalled discussions on managing lethal autonomous weapons, muzzled UN Security Council interventions on human rights violations in Syria and used UN bureaucratic procedures to refute criticisms of China’s Xinjiang policies – shaping multilateral politics in China’s favour. Yet, there is no clear conceptualization and operationalization for what ‘influence’ means, nor how ‘influence’ is exerted in a formal multilateral setting.  In order to address these questions, this paper first theorizes an operable definition for influence, disaggregating and mapping five different influence pathways: coercion, bargaining, persuasion, discourse, and agenda-setting. The paper highlights China’s influence as varying over time, intensity, and issue area, relying upon data-scraping, textual analysis and case sketches of China’s four UN specialized agencies' headships.
