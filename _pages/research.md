"Leader Does Not Speak Lightly": A 70-year Analysis on China’s Official Rhetoric and Costly Actions since 1949 (Under Review)
------

What does China’s rhetoric tell about its intentions in foreign disputes and crises? Existing literature has held either a dismissive view on the credibility of autocracy’s rhetoric or dismissed the role of rhetoric altogether. Challenging the existing canon, I argue that China’s costly behaviors are not unpredictable. Before China conducts costly material actions in foreign disputes and crises, including economic coercion, troop deployments, and military attacks, it inflates the levels of issue salience for legitimation to international audiences. States legitimize their costly material actions because these material actions do not speak for themselves and can be risky to draw balancing coalitions. I test my theoretical predictions through an original Chinese-language lexicon and a dataset that consists of 7,440 \textit{People’s Daily} articles covering 26 China’s foreign disputes and crises since 1949. I find systematic evidence that the more salient China defines a dispute, the more likely and costly it escalates and strikes in both a 30 and 7-day window. A longitudinal case study of the cross-strait relationship from 2010 to 2022 lends further evidence to the statistical results. This study provides a new theoretical perspective that bridges the axiomatic dichotomy between words and deeds. It also has policy implications: Western policymakers should pay more attention to Chinese-language rhetoric to mitigate the risks of unintended conflicts amidst growing U.S-China power competition.

Unraveling China's Military Diplomacy: China's Military Engagement and Cooperation with ASEAN Coauthored with *[Zenobia T. Chan](http://www.zenobiachan.com/)* and *[Noel Foster](https://www.noelfoster.com/)*
------

Does China's military engagement lead to heightened military cooperation in Southeast Asia? While recent International Relations research emphasizes the role of diplomacy in overcoming structural challenges such as relative gain and trust to form military coalitions, most focus on the case of the U.S. and its alliance formation. This paper uniquely explores Chinese military diplomacy, a crucial but often neglected aspect of China's relationship with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Through developing an original dataset encompassing all senior-level Chinese military visits to ASEAN countries since 2000, we observe a consistent diplomatic emphasis by China's high-ranking military leadership, especially under President Xi Jinping, following previous administrations' trends. However, despite these efforts, China's senior military diplomacy shows a discernible lag in evolving into robust security cooperation with ASEAN, including joint military exercises and arms sales. Notably, while ASEAN countries engage in multilateral joint military exercises with China, bilateral exercises remain infrequent. Moreover, high-level engagement doesn't correlate with increased arms sales from China to ASEAN countries. This study challenges the prevailing optimistic narrative of diplomacy overcoming structural barriers between a rising power and its regional states in the existing literature, highlighting that China's military diplomacy is still in the nascent stage of forming deeper security relations with Southeast Asian nations. This is particularly apparent when compared to its economic engagement in the region and the established U.S.-ASEAN military ties.
