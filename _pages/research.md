*["Of Words and Deeds:\\ Preemptive Legitimation, Coercion, and China-Taiwan Relations"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pL7xW3RYEsdCV7NUyA0ybRMwRLR-yX5M/view?usp=sharing)* (Under Review)

When do states preannounce their negative actions against their enemies? Understanding these motivations is crucial to determining how much information a state can deduce about others' intentions from their rhetoric. I introduce the concept of "preemptive legitimation," where states justify military coercion to third-party states in advance. States use this strategy to manage third-party expectations and minimize the risk of third-party military intervention in bilateral conflicts. Conversely, states have less incentive to justify economic coercion in advance, as it is less likely to trigger counter military coalitions. I test these predictions by analyzing China's coercion against Taiwan from 2016-22. By developing a Chinese-language lexicon over 2 million \textit{People’s Daily} articles, I find that China's portrayal of Taiwan-related threats correlates with its military coercion but not its economic coercion. This study provides a theoretical framework that elucidates the relationship between states' rhetoric and actions.

Scholars and policymakers are increasingly reliant on public sources to understand the intentions behind the China’s s foreign policy. However, the reliability of public sources in discerning China's intentions remains contentious. While standard audience cost literature suggests that signals through public channels incur costs, motivating the state to adhere to its commitments, recent studies on “bluster” suggest that autocracies may use hawkish rhetoric to suppress nationalist sentiments, leading to inconsistencies between their words and actions. This project addresses these contrasting perspectives by delving into the hierarchical structure of China’s propaganda system. Drawing from China's official documents, we argue that  authoritative channels within the party-state system are more likely to reflect its true intentions, while less authoritative channels often engage in bluster. We test this hypothesis through a case study of Cross-Strait relations from 2010 to 2023, employing the first systematic, multilingual content analysis of Chinese messaging across various government-sponsored outlets including WeChat, printed channels, and Facebook. Our findings reveal that messaging from less authoritative channels, like \textit{Global Times}, is significantly noisy. In contrast, only threats from the highest authoritative channel, \textit{People's Daily}, predict actual escalatory actions, proxied by the intrusions by the number of China’s jet fighters into Taiwan's air defense identification zone. Furthermore, our computational text analysis confirms that China’s signaling behavior becomes more coordinated before more intense escalations. This study offers a novel theoretical framework for assessing the reliability of propaganda in autocratic regimes.



Unraveling China's Military Diplomacy: China's Military Engagement and Cooperation with ASEAN Coauthored with *[Zenobia T. Chan](http://www.zenobiachan.com/)* and *[Noel Foster](https://www.noelfoster.com/)*

Does China's military engagement lead to heightened military cooperation in Southeast Asia? While recent International Relations research emphasizes the role of diplomacy in overcoming structural challenges such as relative gain and trust to form military coalitions, most focus on the case of the U.S. and its alliance formation. This paper uniquely explores Chinese military diplomacy, a crucial but often neglected aspect of China's relationship with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Through developing an original dataset encompassing all senior-level Chinese military visits to ASEAN countries since 2000, we observe a consistent diplomatic emphasis by China's high-ranking military leadership, especially under President Xi Jinping, following previous administrations' trends. However, despite these efforts, China's senior military diplomacy shows a discernible lag in evolving into robust security cooperation with ASEAN, including joint military exercises and arms sales. Notably, while ASEAN countries engage in multilateral joint military exercises with China, bilateral exercises remain infrequent. Moreover, high-level engagement doesn't correlate with increased arms sales from China to ASEAN countries. This study challenges the prevailing optimistic narrative of diplomacy overcoming structural barriers between a rising power and its regional states in the existing literature, highlighting that China's military diplomacy is still in the nascent stage of forming deeper security relations with Southeast Asian nations. This is particularly apparent when compared to its economic engagement in the region and the established U.S.-ASEAN military ties.
