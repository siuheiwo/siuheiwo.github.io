"Forecasting the Use of Force: A Word Embedding Analysis of China’s Rhetoric and Military Escalations"(Revise and Resubmit to Political Science Research and Methods)
------

Are implicit threats made by autocracies reliable proxies for forecasting military escalations? While the conventional hands-tying mechanism asserts that a state’s official rhetoric binds it to a position, limiting its ability to back down, recent literature on bluster suggests that autocracies may also use hawkish rhetoric to justify inaction and de-escalation ex post. This research evaluates these competing perspectives by analyzing China’s rhetoric and military escalations. Using a word embedding approach, I introduce an original Chinese-language lexicon that captures China’s implicit threats. I present systematic evidence that China’s implicit threats against adversaries correlate with the likelihood of its military escalations. These findings provide new empirical insights into the debate between bluster and hands-tying mechanisms.

When do states preannounce their negative actions against their enemies? Understanding these motivations is crucial to determining how much information a state can deduce about others’ intentions from their rhetoric. I introduce the concept of ”preemptive legitimation,” where states justify military coercion to third-party states in advance. States use this strategy to manage third-party expectations and minimize the risk of third-party military intervention in bilateral conflicts. Conversely, states have less incentive to justify economic coercion in advance, as it is less likely to trig- ger counter military coalitions. I test these predictions by analyzing China’s coercion against Taiwan from 2016-22. By developing a Chinese-language lexicon over 2 million People’s Daily articles, I find that China’s portrayal of Taiwan-related threats correlates with its military coercion but not its economic coercion. This study provides a theoretical framework that elucidates the relationship between states’ rhetoric and actions.

When do public statements reveal a state's true intentions? While much of the international relations literature argues that states issue public threats during crises to tie their own hands, recent research suggests that public signals are often noisier than private ones and states bluster to de-escalate. We contend that a state can simultaneously tie its own hands and bluster during a crisis, albeit through communication channels of different authoritativeness. Less authoritative channels offer plausible deniability, making bluster more likely, whereas states are more inclined to tie their hands through more authoritative channels. Examining China's public threats to Taiwan in 3,635 newspaper articles from 2016–2022, we find systematic evidence supporting our argument. We show that only military threats published in People’s Daily — the most authoritative newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party — forecast incursions by the People’s Liberation Army into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone. In contrast, threats published in less authoritative outlets like the Global Times do not. Our findings reconcile the seemingly contradictory mechanisms of tying hands and bluster, and offer implications for crisis de-escalation.

"Unraveling China's Military Diplomacy: China's Military Engagement and Cooperation with ASEAN" Coauthored with *[Zenobia T. Chan](http://www.zenobiachan.com/)* and *[Noel Foster](https://www.noelfoster.com/)*

Does China's military engagement lead to heightened military cooperation in Southeast Asia? While recent International Relations research emphasizes the role of diplomacy in overcoming structural challenges such as relative gain and trust to form military coalitions, most focus on the case of the U.S. and its alliance formation. This paper uniquely explores Chinese military diplomacy, a crucial but often neglected aspect of China's relationship with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Through developing an original dataset encompassing all senior-level Chinese military visits to ASEAN countries since 2000, we observe a consistent diplomatic emphasis by China's high-ranking military leadership, especially under President Xi Jinping, following previous administrations' trends. However, despite these efforts, China's senior military diplomacy shows a discernible lag in evolving into robust security cooperation with ASEAN, including joint military exercises and arms sales. Notably, while ASEAN countries engage in multilateral joint military exercises with China, bilateral exercises remain infrequent. Moreover, high-level engagement doesn't correlate with increased arms sales from China to ASEAN countries. This study challenges the prevailing optimistic narrative of diplomacy overcoming structural barriers between a rising power and its regional states in the existing literature, highlighting that China's military diplomacy is still in the nascent stage of forming deeper security relations with Southeast Asian nations. This is particularly apparent when compared to its economic engagement in the region and the established U.S.-ASEAN military ties.
