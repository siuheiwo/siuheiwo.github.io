I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of International Studies at the American University of Sharjah](https://www.aus.edu/cas/department-of-international-studies) in the UAE. My research focuses on the intersection between Political Communication and International Security, with a regional focus on Asia.  My book project explores the strategic relationship between China's official rhetoric and crisis response. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science and International Relations from the University of Southern California in August 2024.

My research has been supported by the postdoctoral fellowship at the [Department of Politics at Princeton University](https://politics.princeton.edu), [Hans J. Morgenthau Fellowship at the University of Notre Dame](https://ndisc.nd.edu/people/morgenthau-fellows/), [Wang Gungwu Visiting Fellowship at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute (Singapore)](https://www.iseas.edu.sg/about-us/opportunities-about-us/fellowships/wang-gungwu-visiting-fellows-programme/), predoctoral research fellowships at [George Washington University's Institute for Security and Conflict Studies](https://iscs.elliott.gwu.edu/predoctoral-fellows) and [USC Korean Studies Institute (KSI) ](https://dornsife.usc.edu/ksi/graduate-students/u-s-asia-grand-strategy-fellows/current-and-former-usc-predoctoral-fellows/). I also received grants from [Charles Koch Foundation's Dissertation Fellowship](https://standtogethertrust.org/rfps/foreign-policy-grant/), and [Smith Richardson Foundation's World Politics and Statecraft Fellowship](https://www.srf.org/programs/international-security-foreign-policy/world-politics-statecraft-fellowship/).  

Before my Ph.D.studies, I was a teaching associate at the [Division of Social Science](https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk/) at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I earned my undergraduate degree (University Distinction & Departmental Honors) in Political Science at the University of Michigan, and my master's degree in International Relations at the University of Chicago.
