I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Department of Politics at Princeton University](https://politics.princeton.edu/people/siu-hei-wong) and a [Hans J. Morgenthau Fellow at the University of Notre Dame](https://ndisc.nd.edu/people/morgenthau-fellows/). Starting in Fall 2025, I will be an Assistant Professor at the [Department of International Studies](https://www.aus.edu/cas/department-of-international-studies) at the American University of Sharjah in the UAE. My research focuses on the intersection between Political Communication and International Security, with a regional focus on Asia.  My book project explores the strategic relationship between China's official rhetoric and crisis response. I recieved my Ph.D. in Political Science and International Relations from the University of Southern California in August 2024.
