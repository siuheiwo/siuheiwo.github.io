I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Political Science and International Relations](https://dornsife.usc.edu/poir/) of the University of Southern California and will be a predoctoral research fellow at [George Washington University's Institute for Security and Conflict Studies](https://iscs.elliott.gwu.edu/). My research focuses on the intersection between Political Communication and International Security, with a regional focus on Asia. My dissertation book project explores the strategic relationship between China's official rhetoric and crisis response. My research is supported by the [Charles Koch Foundation's Dissertation Fellowship](https://charleskochfoundation.org/grants/u-s-foreign-policy-dissertations/) and [Smith Richardson Foundation's World Politics and Statecraft Fellowship](https://www.srf.org/programs/international-security-foreign-policy/world-politics-statecraft-fellowship/).

Before that, I was a predoctoral research associate at Princeton University under the supervision of Professor Marc Ratkovic and Professor [Noel Foster](https://www.noelfoster.com/), a [Wang Gungwu visiting fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute (Singapore)](https://www.iseas.edu.sg/about-us/opportunities-about-us/fellowships/wang-gungwu-visiting-fellows-programme/), and a [predoctoral research fellow at Korean Studies Institute (KSI) ](https://dornsife.usc.edu/ksi/us-asia-grand-predoctoral-fellowship/) in USC. My research has been presented in both think tank and academic conferences and received the [Jimmy Carter Best Paper Award on U.S.-China relations](https://uscnpm.org/2022/10/11/announcing-the-winners-2022-young-scholars-forum-on-us-china-relations/). Before my Ph.D.studies, I was a teaching associate at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I received my undergraduate degree (University Distinction & Departmental Honors) in Political Science at the University of Michigan, and my master's degree in International Relations at the University of Chicago.
