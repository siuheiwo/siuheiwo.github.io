I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Department of Politics at Princeton University](https://politics.princeton.edu/) and a [Hans J. Morgenthau Fellow at the University of Notre Dame](https://ndisc.nd.edu/people/fellows/). My research focuses on the intersection between Political Communication and International Security, with a regional focus on Asia.  My book project explores the strategic relationship between China's official rhetoric and crisis response. I recieved my Ph.D. in Political Science and International Relations from the University of Southern California in August 2024. 


My research has been supported by the Predoctoral Research Fellowship at [George Washington University's Institute for Security and Conflict Studies](https://iscs.elliott.gwu.edu/pre-doctoral-fellows/), [Wang Gungwu Visiting Fellowship at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute (Singapore)](https://www.iseas.edu.sg/about-us/opportunities-about-us/fellowships/wang-gungwu-visiting-fellows-programme/),  [Predoctoral Research Fellowship at Korean Studies Institute (KSI) ](https://dornsife.usc.edu/ksi/us-asia-grand-predoctoral-fellowship/), [Charles Koch Foundation's Dissertation Fellowship](https://charleskochfoundation.org/grants/u-s-foreign-policy-dissertations/), and [Smith Richardson Foundation's World Politics and Statecraft Fellowship](https://www.srf.org/programs/international-security-foreign-policy/world-politics-statecraft-fellowship/).  

Before my Ph.D.studies, I was a teaching associate at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I earned my undergraduate degree (University Distinction & Departmental Honors) in Political Science at the University of Michigan, and my master's degree in International Relations at the University of Chicago.
